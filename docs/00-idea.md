# Project idea 

My main goal is to create a Telegram Bot using Java(as before I used to do it with python).
I went through **two YouTube tutorials** covering the fundamentals of building 
Telegram bots using the Java Spring framework.

During this, I built a few smaller bots to:
- test my understanding
- practise core concepts
- validate that I can build working bots from scratch

This project will be a combination of all the knowledge I got.

#Plan

This project will be like a guide for CS students. It will have a lot of different sections, which are useful for students, such as: resources, tools/software, student discounts for educational materials, uni ranking, etc.


#Extra goal

The extra goal of this project is not only to build a working Telegram bot, but to fully understand and practise the entire development process and do everything in details.
